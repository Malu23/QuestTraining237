## STORED PROCEDURE

- A stored procedure is a precompiled collection of one or more SQL statements that can be executed as a single unit. 
- It is stored in the database and can be called by applications or users.  

## CREATING A STORED PROCEDURE

    CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeById
    @EmployeeId INT
    AS
    BEGIN
        SELECT * FROM Employees
        WHERE Id = @EmployeeId;
    END;

## EXECUTING THE STORED PROCEDURE

    EXEC GetEmployeeById @EmployeeId = 1;
    - This stored procedure retrieves the employee details for a given EmployeeId from the Employees table.
    
## ADVANTAGES OF STORED PROCEDURE

    1. Performance: 
        - Stored procedures are precompiled, which can lead to improved performance compared to sending multiple individual SQL statements.

    2. Reusability: 
        - They can be reused multiple times in different applications without rewriting the SQL code.
    
    3. Security: 
        - They can restrict direct access to the tables and enforce security measures by allowing users to execute procedures without giving them direct access to the underlying data.
    
    4. Maintainability: 
        - Changes to business logic can be made in the stored procedure without affecting the application code.
    
    5. Transaction Management: 
        - Stored procedures can manage transactions, ensuring data integrity.
